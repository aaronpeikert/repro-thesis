# Highlight the scientific value

Thank you Prof. VÃ¶kle for pointing out this issue. I made several changes you suggested, that are detailed below.
Additionally, all changes are highlighted in the [GitHub diff view](https://github.com/aaronpeikert/repro-thesis/compare/e22f106247129c6fe4db5428b88577bfefb90590...master).

## Extend introduction of chapter 3

I have extended the introduction in a way that hopefully captures the suggested "I have done x to solve the problem y" perspective.
I was unsure what a semi-technical view entails, but assumed it meant untechnical.
In the case it meant more technical I added several paragraphs in chapter 2 that give an impression of the technical implementation that would be required without `repro`.

## Clarify Figure 3

Previously Figure 3 tried to capture the perspective of a creator and reproducer of an analysis by splitting parts of the workflow.
I have annotated this perspective in the figure and explained it in the text, furthermore, I have linearised the workflow to capture the temporal structure better (but because several actors are implied this is impossible to achieve fully).

## Changing the title

I agree that the title is not specific enough, but cannot address this issue because a change of the title requires as far as I know a new registration of the thesis.

## Extend the relation between Chapter 2 and 3

I extended the brief discussions of what repro does at the end of each section in chapter 2 following Dr. Brandmaier's advice. I also included examples of Make and Docker to highlight the underlying complexity of technical implementation.

# Discussion

I regret that I overlooked the crucial part of discussing limitations, and I am thankful for this suggestion.

I followed your advice to discuss long term reproducibility.
Furthermore, I added a brief glimpse of yet unresolved principle issues.
I tried my best to discuss the limitations of `repro` beyond the most obvious (that it is not fully mature), but I am sure I missed several due to my lack of experience in its use in applied studies.

# Dozens of minor suggestions

Thank you, Dr. Brandmaier, for the host of detailed more specific comments.
