<!-- general structure

Theorethical Considerations
 - practical and metascientific reasons for reproducibility
 - extend definition
 - conclude requirements
 - replication crisis and machine learning as recent developments
 - Peikert & Brandmaier as possible remedy, but impractical
 - Solution: automation

Technical Solutions
- five pillars + high level summary
 - technical vs. non-technical
 - list of technical solutions
    - file organisation
    - literate programming/dynamic document creation
    - version control
    - dependency management
    - virtual environments
    with schema
      - problem description
      - general solution
      - concrete implementation
      - how does repro help

Workflow
vignette styled: from preregistration to post publication review
 - create file structure from template
 - initialite git/github
 - add preregistration.Rmd
 - add data
    - checksum mechanism
 - add preprocessing.Rmd
 - add codebook for data
 - use docker for preprocessing.Rmd
 - factor out data cleaning pipeline
 - turn into make pipeline
 - add analysis.R
 - add manuscript.Rmd
 - publish manuscript.pdf on github.com as preprint
 - archive docker image
 - show how issues may be used in peer-review
    - to track changes in manuscript.Rmd
 - publish manuscript.pdf
 - show pull requests for post publication
